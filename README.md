# Hi
I'm Jon. I was responsible for creating and maintaining some projects many years ago, but as work became increasingly busy, I gradually reduced the time I spent on these projects, causing some of them to be abandoned. I even forgot pay for domains such as abasecode.com and even lost my Github account. Therefore, I recently applied for the opencode.cloud domain and migrated the code projects I owned, as well as performed code upgrades.

Time flies, and I have no intention of losing my passion for coding in the process of writing documents. I'm also afraid of losing myself in the hustle and bustle of the world. Therefore, I will work harder to maintain these projects and create more projects whenever I get inspiration.

您好，我是Jon。我曾多年前创建并维护着一些项目，但随着工作日益繁忙，逐渐减少了投入在这些项目上的时间，以至于部分项目被迫中止。我甚至遗忘了如abasecode.com域名的续费，还有Github的账号。因此，我新近申请了opencode.cloud域名，将我所拥有的代码项目进行了迁移，并进行了代码升级。

时光飞逝，我无意在文书的撰写中丢弃我对于编码的热情，也害怕在纷繁的世俗中迷失自我。因此，我会更加努力去维护这些项目，并尽可能在迸发灵感时创作更多的项目。
